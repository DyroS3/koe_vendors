# Koe_Sellers:
NPCs around the map to either sell items to or buy items from, easy to define in the config.
Rating(XP) System, exports to give, set, get the current rating of player so it can be used in other scripts(when hitting a register, give Crim Rating).
If a vendor is illegal you can require a certain amount of crim rating for the player to be able to buy the item. 
Civilian rating will give a boost in the amount of money they get paid on the legal sellers. 
Easy to add as many vendors as you want, uses zones for spawning of the npcs for optimization.
